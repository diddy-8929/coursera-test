                <p>
                    C++ is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part 
                    of the evolution of the C family of languages. C++ is pronounced "see-plus-plus." It was developed as a cross-platform 
                    improvement of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system resources.

                    JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, 
                    whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted 
                    programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

                    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
                    Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
                    Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
