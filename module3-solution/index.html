            <p>
                C++ is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist 
                Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages. 
                C++ is pronounced "see-plus-plus." It was developed as a cross-platform improvement 
                of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system 
                resources. Some call C++ “C with classes” because it introduces object-oriented 
                programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming 
                language framework. Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in 
                computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object-oriented 
                programming works. However, it does not support only object-oriented, but also procedural 
                and functional. Thanks to its high flexibility and scalability, C++ can be used to 
                develop a broad range of software, applications, browsers, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), 
                operating systems, and games. Today C++ is still very appreciated for its notable 
                portability which allows developers to create programs that can run on different 
                operating systems or platforms very easily. Despite being a high-level language, 
                since C++ is still close to C it can be used for low-level manipulation due to its 
                close relation with machine language.
