                        <p>
                            C++ is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist 
                            Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages. 
                            C++ is pronounced "see-plus-plus." It was developed as a cross-platform improvement 
                            of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system 
                            resources. Some call C++ “C with classes” because it introduces object-oriented 
                            programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming 
                            language framework. Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in 
                            computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object-oriented 
                            programming works. However, it does not support only object-oriented, but also procedural 
                            and functional. Thanks to its high flexibility and scalability, C++ can be used to 
                            develop a broad range of software, applications, browsers, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), 
                            operating systems, and games. Today C++ is still very appreciated for its notable 
                            portability which allows developers to create programs that can run on different 
                            operating systems or platforms very easily. Despite being a high-level language, 
                            since C++ is still close to C it can be used for low-level manipulation due to its 
                            close relation with machine language.

                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. 
                            It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and 
                            interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, 
                            the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting 
                            language developed by Sun Microsystems. JavaScript is a client-side scripting 
                            language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser 
                            rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a 
                            webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript 
                            function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required 
                            fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message 
                            before any information is actually transmitted to the server. Like server-side 
                            scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere 
                            within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is 
                            displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of 
                            the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be 
                            viewed in a browser.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">Python</h3>
                        <p>
                            In technical terms, Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming 
                            language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. 
                            It is extremely attractive in the field of Rapid Application Development because 
                            it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options. Python is relatively simple, 
                            so it’s easy to learn since it requires a unique syntax that focuses on readability. 
                            Developers can read and translate Python code much easier than other languages. 
                            In turn, this reduces the cost of program maintenance and development because it 
                            allows teams to work collaboratively without significant language and experience 
                            barriers. Additionally, Python supports the use of modules and packages, which means 
                            that programs can be designed in a modular style and code can be reused across a variety 
                            of projects. Once you’ve developed a module or package you need, it can be scaled for 
                            use in other projects, and it’s easy to import or export these modules.One of the most 
                            promising benefits of Python is that both the standard library and the interpreter are 
                            available free of charge, in both binary and source form. There is no exclusivity either, 
                            as Python and all the necessary tools are available on all major platforms. Therefore, 
                            it is an enticing option for developers who don’t want to worry about paying high 
                            development costs. If this description of Python over your head, don’t worry. 
                            You’ll understand it soon enough. What you need to take away from this section 
                            is that Python is a programming language used to develop software on the web and 
                            in app form, including mobile. It’s relatively easy to learn, and the necessary 
                            tools are available to all free of charge. That makes Python accessible to almost anyone. 
                            If you have the time to learn, you can create some amazing things with the language.
